# Homework 2


The homework tasks are described in the `2025_HW2.ipynb` file.

Most of the tasks require you to write code to solve them. It's recommended to explain your reasoning as comments in the code cells which can help TA to better understand your solution.
Some questions may be answered without coding, in which case you can write your answer in a markdown cell or as a comment in a code cell. Additionally, it is recommended to create a new conda environment with `python=3.13.9` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary dependencies before solving the homework.


### Submission Guidelines

You are expected to solve the homework as a team of *five*, which you specified in the course registration form. By the homework submission deadline, each team should have a single shared private GitHub repo under the *epfl-ada* organization, containing the Jupyter Notebook with the solution. 
Please, follow the instructions below to create your team repo and start working on the homework:
1. **One** team member should follow [this link](https://classroom.github.com/a/KyajBCMS) to create a GitHub repo `ada-2025-homework-2-<your-team-name>`.
*Note: You might notice `ada-2025-homework-2-<your-personal-GitHub-handle>` instead of `ada-2025-homework-2-<your-team-name>` as the name of the automatically created repo. This is a GitHub classroom bug (or feature), and fixing this is neither in our capacity nor purview. That said, please don't worry, the eventual created repo would be named `ada-2025-homework-2-<your-team-name>`.*
2. The remaining four team-members should also have access to the created GitHub repo. 
3. There is no simple automated way to transfer the materials for Homework 2 from the public course repository into your private team repository. To get started, we suggest that you manually pull the homework materials from the course repository to your local machine, copy them into your local team repository, and push to the remote.
4. Afterwards -- keep collaborating on the homework as a team in your shared private repository.
5. Most importantly, don’t forget to push the final solved version by **November 26th, 23:59 (CET)**!

### Deliverables
1. `2025_HW2.ipynb` notebook with disclosed output for each cell. **Please don't update the data folders provided in the repository, i.e., use it in read-only mode.**

#### Deadline: Wednesday, November 26th, 23:59 (CET)

## Good luck!
