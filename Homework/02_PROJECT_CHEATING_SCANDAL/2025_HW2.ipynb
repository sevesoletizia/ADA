    "\n",
    "By the end of this homework, we expect you to be able to:\n",
    "- Load data and handle data using pandas;\n",
    "- Navigate the documentation of Python packages by yourself;\n",
    "- Filter and tidy up noisy real-world datasets;\n",
    "- Aggregate your data in different (and hopefully helpful) ways;\n",
    "- Create meaningful visualizations to analyze the data;\n",
    "- Communicate your findings in a clear and concise manner\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Dates.**\n",
    "- Homework release: Wed 05 Nov, 2025\n",
    "- Homework due: Wed 26 Nov, 2025, 23:59 (CET)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some rules**\n",
    "- You are allowed to use any built-in Python library that comes with Anaconda. If you want to use an external library, you may do so, but must justify your choice.\n",
    "- Make sure you use the data folder provided in the repository in read-only mode. (Or alternatively, be sure you don’t change any of the files.)\n",
    "- Be sure to provide a concise textual description of your thought process, the assumptions you made, the solution you implemented, and explanations for your answers. A notebook that only has code cells will not suffice. To avoid confusion: use short comments for longer code answers.\n",
    "- For questions containing the /Discuss:/ prefix, answer not with code, but with a textual explanation (in markdown).\n",
    "- Back up any hypotheses and claims with data, since this is an important aspect of the course.\n",
    "- Please write all your comments in English, and use meaningful variable names in your code. Your repo should have a single notebook (plus the required data files) in the master/main branch. If there are multiple notebooks present, we will not grade anything.\n",
    "- We will not run your notebook for you! Rather, we will grade it as is, which means that only the results contained in your evaluated code cells will be considered, and we will not see the results in unevaluated code cells. Thus, be sure to hand in a fully-run and evaluated notebook. In order to check whether everything looks as intended, you can check the rendered notebook on the GitHub website once you have pushed your solution there.\n",
    "- In continuation to the previous point, interactive plots, such as those generated using the ‘plotly’ package, should be strictly avoided! Make sure to print results and/or dataframes that confirm you have properly addressed the task.  \n",
    "- In this homework, we have a task that asks to do clustering. Clustering algorithms will be covered in the lecture on unsupervised learning on Nov 12, 2025.\n",

    "**A Note on using Language Models (LMs)**\n",
    "If you try hard enough, you will likely get away with cheating. Fortunately, our job is not to police, but rather to educate! So, please consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Presumably, you are taking this course to learn something! LMs are not always right (they often fail in silly ways). This course should prepare you to detect when they are wrong!\n",

    "\n",
    "In the sleepy university town of Bobwest, a scandal is rocking the community. St. Bob, a well-respected university known for its demanding curriculum, is facing allegations of widespread cheating since the introduction of ChatGPT! The basis of the allegations? A recent audit has found a significant year-over-year jump in the graduating class's grade point averages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eager to restore their reputation and facing immense public scrutiny, St. Bob’s dean of students, Ms. Sakota, has contacted EPFL’s renowned ADA staff to perform a rigorous analysis. The goal is to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Determine if the jump in GPAs is likely due to cheating. 🧐\n",
    "- If so, identify the culprits. 🕵️\n",
    "- Propose ways to prevent it from happening in the future. 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "Ms. Sakota has commissioned the university’s IT team to prepare a number of files to aid in the analysis. Unfortunately, the university’s systems have undergone many changes over the years. She thus warns the ADA staff to send their best and brightest representatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files for this assignment\n",
    "This assignment is divided into four tasks tasks, each of which should bring you a step closer to providing a recommendation to Ms. Sakota:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task 1**: Preparing data the right way\n",
    "- **Task 2**: Inspecting the data using statistical tests\n",
    "- **Task 3**: Analyzing the problem through causal analysis\n",
